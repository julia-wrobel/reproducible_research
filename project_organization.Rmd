## Examples

### Example 1: creating a new project

In this exercise we will create a new project that will be used throughout the rest of this course. I highly encourage you to follow along with me.


1. Use `projectr::proj_start()` to initiate a new project called `20240722_sismid_repro`.   Set up a directory in a separate location using the argument `data_dir`. I typically store my data on OneDrive, but the idea is to put it in a secure location.


**Run the following code in R**

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Setting up a folder WITH a symbolic link to the data subfolder
projectr::proj_start(proj_dir = "~/icloud/Documents/projects/2024/20240722_sismid_repro", 
                     data_dir = "~/onedrive/Data/2024/20240722_sismid_repro") 
```

Next, open the new project by double clicking the `.Rproj` icon. This will open up a new Rstudio session with the working director set to that project folder. It will also set the working directory of the terminal tab to that folder.


2. Download the [data download script](scripts/01_data_download.R) and save it in the `source` folder of your new project directory as `01_data_download.R`.

It would be fine to copy/paste the code for `01_data_download.R` and saving it via point and click, but you can also do this using tools from the command line module by entering the following into the terminal:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
echo '# install.packages("RSocrata")
library("RSocrata")
library(tidyverse)

# download longitudinal Covid WW concentration data from API
covid <- read.socrata(
  "https://data.cdc.gov/resource/g653-rqe2.json",
  app_token = Sys.getenv("TOKEN"),
  email     = Sys.getenv("EMAIL"),
  password  = Sys.getenv("PASSWORD")
) %>%
  mutate(date_downloaded = Sys.Date())


# download cross-sectional Covid WW concentration data from API, which will be used to get county names
counties <- read.socrata(
  "https://data.cdc.gov/resource/2ew6-ywp6.json",
  app_token = Sys.getenv("TOKEN"),
  email     = Sys.getenv("EMAIL"),
  password  = Sys.getenv("PASSWORD")
)


## save intermediate data object and data data was accessed
save(covid, counties, file = here::here("data", "raw.Rdata"))' > source/01_data_download.R
```


Check that you have saved this script in the `source` folder using the terminal tab:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
ls source
```



3. Make an Rmarkdown document that knits to html called `final_report.Rmd` and put it in the `analysis` folder of your project directory.


<img src="slides/figures/template.png" style="width:50%">

We will come back to the `final_report.Rmd` document later in the lecture.


### Example 2: adding `.Renviron` variables

1. Add a `.Renviron` file to the root directory of your `20240722_sismid_repro` project folder.

Open the terminal. I will use the terminal tab of the `20240722_sismid_repro` project. First, check that your working directory is `20240722_sismid_repro`.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
pwd
```

If you are not in the correct directory use the `cd` command to move into `~\20240722_sismid_repro`. Next, create and open the `.Renviron` file.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
touch .Renviron
open .Renviron
```

2. Edit the `.Renviron` file by defining variables called TOKEN, EMAIL, an PASSWORD that contain your app token, and email and password used to obtain your app token.  

Your edited `.Renviron` file should look something like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
PASSWORD="password333"
EMAIL="julia.wrobel@emory.edu"
TOKEN="K1MVpmwDDeefZ0vPuYk2wRN"
```

Close your R session and then reopen it by double-clicking `20240722_sismid_repro`.  Your environment variables defined through `.Renviron` should now be defined. 

You can check by typing the following into the R console:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
Sys.getenv("EMAIL")
```

This should print out your email address.

3. Add the `.Renviron` file to your `.gitignore` file. 

This is not necessary for accessing the environment variables you just defined, but will be important for later in the course when we start using git and GitHub. **You do not want to accidentally put your .Renviron on GitHub**, and by adding the file to `.gitignore` we can avoid this mistake.

To do this, go to your terminal and execute the following  two lines of code:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
echo "" >> .gitignore # ensures you are writing on a new line
echo ".Renviron" >> .gitignore
```

Alternatively, you can just open the .gitignore file and add `.Renviron` on a new line. Sometimes I find this to be simpler.

4. Check that the code in your `01_data_download.R` file will run.



### Example 3

1. Using the `projectr` template, make an Rmarkdown document called `exploratory_analysis.Rmd` and put it in the `analysis` folder of your project directory. Load and explore the data. Take notes on what you learn. Add in brief descriptions of the key variables.

Might be helpful to reference the page [about the data](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/NWSS-Public-SARS-CoV-2-Wastewater-Metric-Data/2ew6-ywp6/about_data).

2. Download the [data cleaning script](scripts/02_data_cleaning.R) and save it in the `source` folder of your new project directory as `02_data_cleaning.R`.


```{bash, eval = FALSE}
echo '# set up a variable to define which state you want to analyze
state = "ga"

# download raw data
source(here::here("source", "01_data_download.R"))

# grab only observations from the specified state
covid = covid %>%
  filter(grepl(state, key_plot_id))


# only include columns from counties dataset we are interested in
counties = counties %>%
  filter(grepl(state, key_plot_id)) %>%
  select(key_plot_id, wwtp_id, county = county_names,
         county_fips, population_served) %>%
  distinct()

# merge covid data with the county label information
# convert  variables from character to numeric
# concentration variable more intuitive name
covid = left_join(covid, counties, by = "key_plot_id") %>%
  select(-key_plot_id) %>%
  mutate(pcr_conc_lin = as.numeric(pcr_conc_lin),
         population_served = as.numeric(population_served)) %>%
  rename(concentration = pcr_conc_lin)


## save intermediate data object and data data was accessed
save(covid, file = here::here("data", "clean.Rdata"))
' > source/02_data_cleaning.R
```


3. Download the [data analysis script](scripts/03_data_analysis.R) and save it in the `source` folder of your new project directory as `03_data_analysis.R`.

4. Download the [data visualization script](scripts/04_data_visualization.R) and save it in the `source` folder of your new project directory as `04_data_visualization.R`.


5. Open your `final_report.Rmd` document and source each of the scripts. Add comments to explain the document. 

## Breakout exercises

### Exercise 1


In your breakout group, turn your `final_report.Rmd` document into a parameterized report with the following parameters:

* a `state` parameter that reads in a character vector that is the abbreviation of a US state (e.g. "ga")
* a parameter called `download_raw_data` that takes in logical values (TRUE/FALSE). If set to TRUE, the raw data will be downloaded from the CDC API. If set to FALSE, the other steps of the analysis will proceed without downloadeding the raw data.


<button type="button" class="collapsible">View solution</button>
<div class="content">

The YAML header will look like this:

````
---
title: "Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 concentration in wastewater"
author: "Julia Wrobel"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output:
  html_document:
    code_folding: hide
    toc: true
    toc_float: true
params:
  state: "ga"
  download_raw_data: FALSE
hitheme: tomorrow
highlighter: highlight.js
---
````

The default state is Georgia.

To be able to filter by state, we will need to add a line of code to the file `02_data_cleaning.R` so that it can access the value of `param$state`. Add the following line of code to the beginning of the `02_data_cleaning.R` file.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
state = params$state
```


We add the param `download_raw_data` with the following code to allow the user to toggle whether or not to download the raw data.

```{r}
if(params$download_raw_data){
  source(here("source", "01_data_download.R")) 
}else if(!file.exists(here::here("data", "raw.Rdata"))){
  source(here("source", "01_data_download.R")) 
}

source(here("source", "02_data_cleaning.R"))  
```

Finally, we can run the parameterized report by knitting the document, or by running the following code in the R console:

```{r}
rmarkdown::render(here::here("analysis","final_report.Rmd"), params = list(
  state = "nj",
  download_raw_data = TRUE
))
```



A copy of the entire `20240722_sismid_repro` folder with parameterized final report is available for download [here](scripts/20240722_sismid_repro.zip).


</div>


### Exercise 2

Write a function in R that will run your `final_report.Rmd` for all US states and output a different html document for each state. The function should store the documents in your "results" folder.

<button type="button" class="collapsible">View solution</button>
<div class="content">

The function is below:

```{r}
render_report = function(state, download_raw_data = FALSE) {
  filename = paste0("Report-", state, "-", download_raw_data, ".html")
    
  rmarkdown::render(here::here("analysis","final_report.Rmd"), params = list(
    state = state,
    download_raw_data = download_raw_data
    ),
    output_file = here::here("results", filename)
  )
}
```

Run the function for 5 states:

```{r}
lapply(c("ga", "co", "ny", "pa", "nj"), render_report)
```


</div>

### Exercise 3


1. Use `projectr::proj_start()` to initiate a new project called `20240722_YOURNAME_sismid`.   Use the argument `data_dir = NULL`. Where is your data being stored?
2. Using the terminal, set up a symbolic link for where you will store data for this course that points to `20240722_YOURNAME_sismid/data`.


<button type="button" class="collapsible">View solution</button>
<div class="content">

Set up the project directory structure.

```{r, exercise1, eval = FALSE}
## set up a new project
# devtools::install_github("julia-wrobel/projectr")
library(projectr)


# Setting up a folder without a symbolic link to the data subfolder
projectr::proj_start(proj_dir = "~/icloud/Documents/projects/2024/202407_wrobel_sismid", 
                     data_dir = NULL) 

```


Set a symbolic link by opening a Terminal window and executing code like the following. Note that I am storing my data in a folder on OneDrive and you may want to store yours elsewhere.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
ln -s "~/onedrive/Data/2024/202407_wrobel_sismid"  "~/projects/2024/202407_wrobel_sismid/data" 
```
