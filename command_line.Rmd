## Exercise 1

Open the terminal and perform the following tasks:

1. What is your current working directory?
2. In your current directory, make a directory named `tmp`
3. Navigate into this new folder called `tmp`
4. Add an empty file named `tmp_file`
5. Within `tmp`, add an empty directory named `another_tmp`
6. Within `another_tmp`, add an additional empty file named `another_tmp_file`


<button type="button" class="collapsible">View solution</button>
<div class="content">

Execute the following code in your terminal:

```{bash, exercise1, eval = FALSE}
# check your current working directory
pwd
# make a directory named tmp
mkdir tmp
# move into tmp 
cd tmp
# add an empty file named tmp_file
touch tmp_file
# add an empty directory named another_tmp
mkdir another_tmp
# add an empty file to another_tmp directory
touch another_tmp/another_tmp_file
```

</div>


## Exercise 2

Form a group, figure out how to...
  
1. list all files with sizes displayed in bytes/kilobyes/megabytes
2. remove `tmp_file`
3. rename `another_tmp_file` to `such_a_cool_file`
4. remove `tmp` directory *and* all its contents

<button type="button" class="collapsible">View solution</button>
<div class="content">

Execute the following code in your terminal. Note that this is one way and there are other possible solutions!

```{bash, exercise2, eval = FALSE}
# list all files with sizes displayed in bytes/kilobyes/megabytes
ls -lhR
# remove `tmp_file`
rm tmp_file
# rename `another_tmp_file` to `such_a_cool_file`
cd another_tmp
mv another_tmp_file such_a_cool_file 
# remove `tmp` directory *and* all its contents
cd ../..
rm -r tmp
```

</div>




## Exercise 3

In your breakout group, write bash code that executes each of the following. 
* find "To be, or not to be" and write the contents of this monologue to a file `speech.txt` (hint: the speech is 35 lines)
* make a file called `greatest_hits.txt` that includes:
  * the "To be, or not to be" speech
  * the line that includes "know not what we may be"
  * all lines that include the word "doubts" or "Doubts"
* replaces all instances of the string "doubts" with "uncertainties" in your `greatest_hits.txt` file (hint: `sed` or `awk`)



## Exercise 4

Write a script that 
* uses `curl` to download the text of __Romeo and Juliet__ from Project Gutenberg
  * http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt ;
* counts the number of lines for characters Romeo ("Rom."), Juliet ("Jul."), and the Apothecary ("Apoth."); 
* saves a plain text file that for each of these characters says:
  * "`[character]` has `[num]` lines".

__Hints__: use `for` loops
