## Breakout exercise 1

Execute the following code:
```{bash, exercise1, eval = FALSE}
# make a directory named tmp
mkdir tmp
# move into tmp 
cd tmp
# add an empty file named tmp_file
touch tmp_file
# add an empty directory named another_tmp
mkdir another_tmp
# add an empty file to another_tmp directory
touch another_tmp/another_tmp_file
```
* In your breakout group, figure out how to...
  * list all files with sizes displayed in bytes/kilobyes/megabytes
  * remove `tmp_file`
  * rename `another_tmp_file` to `such_a_cool_file`
  * remove `tmp` directory *and* all its contents

???

~ 7 minutes.


## Breakout exercise 2

In your breakout group, write bash code that executes each of the following. 
* find "To be, or not to be" and write the contents of this monologue to a file `speech.txt` (hint: the speech is 35 lines)
* make a file called `greatest_hits.txt` that includes:
  * the "To be, or not to be" speech
  * the line that includes "know not what we may be"
  * all lines that include the word "doubts" or "Doubts"
* replaces all instances of the string "doubts" with "uncertainties" in your `greatest_hits.txt` file (hint: `sed` or `awk`)

???

`sed` and `awk` are more flexible than `grep`, but I find the syntax very cryptic and
difficult to remember. I often have to Google to remind myself how it works.

~ 10-15 min

## Breakout exercise 3

Write a script that 
* uses `curl` to download the text of __Romeo and Juliet__ from Project Gutenberg
  * http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt ;
* counts the number of lines for characters Romeo ("Rom."), Juliet ("Jul."), and the Apothecary ("Apoth."); 
* saves a plain text file that for each of these characters says:
  * "`[character]` has `[num]` lines".

__Hints__: use `for` loops
