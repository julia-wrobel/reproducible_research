## The problem

Trying to run someone else's code.

.code-box[
\> library(ggplot2) <br>
.red[Error in library(ggplot2) : there is no package called â€˜ggplot2â€™] <br>
\> install.packages("ggplot2") <br>
.red[configure: error: no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH] <br> 
]

...so you Google the error, install `gcc`, re-install the package. ðŸ˜•

.code-box[
\> library(xgboost) <br>
.red[Error in library(xgboost) : there is no package called â€˜xgboostâ€™] <br>
\> install.packages("xgboost") <br> 
.red[package â€˜xgboostâ€™ is not available (for R version 3.2.0)]
]

...so you update `R`. ðŸ˜ 

---

## The problem

.code-box[
\> install.packages("xgboost") <br>
.red[make: *** [xgboost.so] Error 127] <br> 
.red[ERROR: compilation failed for package 'xgboost']
]

...so you google this compilation error, fix and install package. ðŸ˜¡

.code-box[
\> library(ggplot2) <br>
.red[Error in library(ggplot2) : there is no package called â€˜ggplot2â€™] <br>
]

.center[.huge[ðŸ¤¬]]

???

Is this really reproducible if the barrier to reproducing is so high?

---

## Docker

.large[Key principle: .red[Software is code!]]

We have talked only about making *our* __code reproducible__. 
* Running our code requires software. 
* That software is built from code. 

We want a way to package up all __analysis code AND software__. 
* Reproduce the analysis in its entirety.
  * On Windows, on Mac, in cloud, ...
* No ðŸ¤¬ required. 

__Containerization__ gives us a way to do this. 
* __Docker__ is a popular containerization program. 


---

## Docker

Think of a Docker container as a __virtual machine__:
* Has its own (Unix) operating system
* Has its own file system 
* Has its own software applications

```{r inception, echo = FALSE, out.width = "518px", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("inception2.gif")
```

???

But it's actually much smarter, more lightweight than a virtual machine.

---

## Images vs. containers

__Docker image__
* source code, libraries, dependencies, tools, and other files needed to `run` a container.
* a __blueprint__ for the environment in which you will execute your analysis.
* we `build` docker images.

__Docker container__
* created when we `run` an image. 
* construct a run-time environment to execute your code.
* or provide an interactive way to execute code.
* we `run` docker images to create containers.

---

## Docker

How does it work?
* Docker is an installed program.
* Write `Dockerfile`, plain text that tells Docker what to put in image.
* `build` the image. 
* `run` the image (creating container) to execute code.

```{r zoolander, echo = FALSE, out.width = "518px", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("zoolander_short.gif")
```

---

## DockerHub

We will start off by running pre-built images hosted on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu?tab=tags)
* GitHub for images!

Many images. Many free, some not.
* [R/Rstudio](https://hub.docker.com/u/rocker/)
* [Ubuntu](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu)
* [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx)
* [many others](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&type=image)

[Sign up](https://hub.docker.com/) for an account.

---

## rocker images

[R/Rstudio](https://hub.docker.com/u/rocker/) images are available from `rocker`
* [`rocker/tidyverse`](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/tidyverse)
  * R + R Studio server + `tidyverse` packages
  * what we will use in this class
* [`rocker/rstudio`](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/rstudio)
  * R Studio server version
* [`rocker/r-ubuntu`](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/r-ubuntu)
  * only `R` installed with Ubuntu OS
* [`rocker/tidyverse`](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/tidyverse) 
  * `rstudio` + `devtools` and `tidyverse` packages

---

## rocker images

The `rocker/tidyverse` image has an [Ubuntu operating system](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu)
* popular Linux operating system

The container has its own file system
* we made note of the existence of an empty directory `/home/rstudio`

R can be opened from the command line by typing `R` and pressing Enter

.large[
`r fontawesome::fa("desktop", fill = "#ffffff")` .white[Running R Studio in a container]
]

???

* run `rocker/rstudio:4.4.1` with password set
* open browser and navigate to `localhost:8787`
* sign in to R Studio
* check working directory

---

## R Studio images

To use R Studio inside a container we run the following command

.code-box[
davidbenkeser$ docker run -e PASSWORD="SECRET123" -p 8787:8787 rocker/rstudio:4.4.1<br>
...<br>
[services.d] done.
]

Open web browser and go to http://localhost:8787.
* Username: rstudio
* Password: `SECRET123`

Notice that the default working directory is `/home/rstudio`

When finished, use `ctrl + c` to stop the container

---

## Mounting directories

How can we get code and data into container?

How can we get results out of the container?

One solution is to mount a local directory to a directory inside a container.
* A directory on our local file system that is viewable inside the container

In the next exercise, we will mount our project directory to `/home/rstudio` inside the container.

---

class: title-slide, center, inverse, middle
background-color: #487f84

.large[
`r fontawesome::fa("desktop", fill = "#ffffff")` .white[Mounting project directory]
]

???

* confirm working directory is in project root directory
* run `rocker/rstudio:4.4.1` with password set
* include `-v $(pwd):/home/rstudio`
* open browser and navigate to `localhost:8787`
* view files in file finder in container
* try to run code
* note that packages are not installed
* install packages, run code
* exit container, repeat
* note that packages are not installed again

---

## `Dockerfile`

How can we get software/code/other stuff into an image?
* That way we do not need to e.g., install R packages every time!

We can build our own image using a `Dockerfile`.
* A plain text file with all commands needed to build image.
* Have their own (reasonably straightforward) syntax.

If you can install it from the command line, you can install it in a container!

---

## `Dockerfile`

.code-box[
FROM rocker/rstudio:4.4.1<br><br>
\# install R package from command line <br>
RUN Rscript -e "install.packages('RSocrata')<br><br>
]

* Save contents in plain text file named `Dockerfile`. 
* `cd` to directory containing `Dockerfile`.

.code-box[
davidbenkeser$ docker build -t rstudio-plus . <br>
... <br>
Successfully built 3f3def993815 <br>
Successfully tagged rstudio-plus:latest
]

Now we can use `docker run <options> rstudio-plus` to create a container with packages installed.

???

The `-t` option to `docker build` sets a "tag". That is, how we will reference the container in the future.

The argument to `docker build` is either:
* a path to a folder that contains a file called `Dockerfile`
* or a path to a `Dockerfile` with a different name.
  * e.g., `docker build -t foo ./bar.Dockerfile`

---

## `Dockerfile`

Common `Dockerfile` instructions

| `INSTRUCTION` | Action                                 |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| [`FROM`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from)        | the parent image for your build        |
| [`RUN`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#run)         | run a command in a shell               |
| [`COPY`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy)        | copy file from a local folder to image |
| [`ENV`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#env)         | set an environment variable            |
| [`WORKDIR`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#workdir)     | set working directory for `RUN` commands|
| [`CMD`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd)         | container "entry point"                |


???

Full details [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).

There's actually no need to have `INSTRUCTION` be uppercase, but it's convention and makes for nicer formatting.

class: title-slide, center, inverse, middle
background-color: #487f84

.large[
`r fontawesome::fa("desktop", fill = "#ffffff")` .white[Building your own image]
]

???

* confirm working directory is in project root directory
* create a Dockerfile that installs all needed packages
* user `docker build` to build the image
* use `docker run` to run the image
  * include `-v $(pwd):/home/rstudio`
  * open browser and navigate to `localhost:8787`
* run code

---

## Pushing images to DockerHub

Share your images by building locally and using `docker push`.
* On the build, use `-t <dockerhub.uname>/<repo.name>:<tag>`

For example, my dockerhub user name is `dbenkeser`.

.code-box[
davidbenkeser$ docker build -t dbenkeser/rstudio-plus .<br>
...<br>
davidbenkeser$ docker push dbenkeser/rstudio-plus <br>
]

If you do not specify a `tag`, default is `latest`.

---

## Installing other software

Sometimes R packages require compilation using other software.
* E.g., `gfortran`, `gcc`, ...

You may see an error like this:

.code-box[
------------------------- ANTICONF ERROR ---------------------------<br>
Configuration failed because libcurl was not found. Try installing:<br>
 \* deb: libcurl4-openssl-dev (Debian, Ubuntu, etc)<br>
 \* rpm: libcurl-devel (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL)<br>
 \* csw: libcurl_dev (Solaris)<br><br>
If libcurl is already installed, check that 'pkg-config' is in your<br>
PATH and PKG_CONFIG_PATH contains a libcurl.pc file. If pkg-config<br>
is unavailable you can set INCLUDE_DIR and LIB_DIR manually via:<br>
R CMD INSTALL --configure-vars='INCLUDE_DIR=... LIB_DIR=...'<br>
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
]

---

## Installing other software

The key line is here:

.code-box[
Configuration failed because libcurl was not found. Try installing:<br>
 \* deb: libcurl4-openssl-dev (Debian, Ubuntu, etc)
]

We need to install a separate piece of software called `libcurl`.

This software is available in the `libcurl4-openssl-dev` package.
* Not an R package!

---

## Installing other software

To install this software, include the following in your `Dockerfile` __before__ your `RUN` command that installs the password.

.code-box[
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y libcurl4-openssl-dev
]

It can sometimes also be helpful to include the following command prior to the calls to `apt-get install`

.code-box[
ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
]

???

`apt` is a software repository for Debian-based Linux systems (of which Ubuntu is one example). 

The call to `update` gets the most recent indexes of packages available in the `apt` repository.

The call to `install` actually installs the required software.

Adding `-y` option says "answer yes" if the install process asks any questions.

Setting `DEBIAN_FRONTEND` variable says "try to install without asking me any questions at all"

---

## Viewing/removing containers/images

`docker container ps`
* list running containers
* add `-a` option to see __all__ recently run containers

`docker images`
* list all downloaded images

`docker image rm [id]`
* replace `[id]` with code from `IMAGE ID` column of `docker images`

`docker system prune`
* remove all unused images and containers
* add `-a` to remove everything

???

You definitely want to `prune` from time to time; images can start to take up quite a bit of your computer's memory. But just be aware that removing images and containers, future builds may take longer (because you will have to re-install the image for your build). 

---

## Other Docker uses

Docker can be used for many purposes:

* customizing R-based workflows using `ENV` variables
* sharing data with fully reproducible code
* deploying [shiny apps](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/shiny)
* deploying other web apps
* ...
