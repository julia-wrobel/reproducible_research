This document outlines how to use collapsibles as an exercise solution

## Exercise 1

Suppose I have a variable named `NAME` that evaluates to `David`. How could I use bash to print out the string `'My name is David'` while referencing the variable `NAME`?

<button type="button" class="collapsible">View solution</button>
<div class="content">

We can use `echo` while referencing the variable `NAME` as follows.

```{bash}
NAME=David
echo "My name is $NAME"
```

Be sure to use double quotes or else bash will print verbatim.

```{bash}
echo 'My name is $NAME'
```

</div>

## Exercise 2

Suppose I have an array of variables called `NAMES`. How can I loop through each name and print `'My name is <NAME>'` where `<NAME>` is replaced with each name in `NAMES`?

<button type="button" class="collapsible">View solution</button>
<div class="content">

We can use a `for` loop, combined with `echo`.

```{bash}
NAMES=(David Julia)

for NAME in ${NAMES[@]}
do
  echo "My name is $NAME"
done
```

</div>
